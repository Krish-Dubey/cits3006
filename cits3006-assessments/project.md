# Project

In this project, you will be working as a team to perform both penetration and defence techniques. Details are as follows.

## Task 1: Team forming (Week 8)

This project is to be carried out as a team.&#x20;

You are free to form your own team, but you must ensure that at least one member has VirtualBox available, as the provided boxes will be in `.ova` format (no M1/2 support).&#x20;

The number of members should be 4 or 5 (6 may be considered - please ask).

Once the team has been formed, go to MS Teams -> Project Discussion, and there is the "CITS3006 Project Group Allocations" tab. Open the tab and enter your team's details (team name, leader and members).

Once your team is finalised, your team will be placed into a private channel on MS Teams, where you will work on the team report.&#x20;

Please note that you will also be keeping records of individual contributions as part of the team report (format details later).

## Task 2: Exploit the box (Week 9)

Your team will be given a link to the box for you to exploit. You will have one week to exploit the given box. This means if you wish to demo in Tuesday's lab, you will receive your box on Tuesday, and if you wish to demo in Thursday's lab, you will receive your box on Thursday.

{% hint style="danger" %}
You are not meant to share your box info with any other teams - this is an official assessment item that you cannot share with others other than your team members.
{% endhint %}

There are no other details provided - you are free to demonstrate any penetration testing skills on the given box.

On your team report, write the penetration testing activities you have performed and the outcomes. More merit will be given to successful exploits (see rubrics for more details), but you will still be rewarded for various penetration testing activities you have done even if they were unsuccessful.

On the same report, create a separate page for each member (the page should start with the member's details). This should log the contributions made by each member.

## Task 3: Demo (Week 10)

You are required to demonstrate your task 2 during the scheduled lab - on the same day you received your box. The standard UWA late penalty applies to all members if you defer your demo (i.e., -5% from raw marks).

## Task 4: Patch the box (Week 10)

You are going to patch the box you are given. Two versions of patching are done:

1. Full patch - fully patch all vulnerabilities you can.
2. Partial patch - leave some vulnerabilities that can still be exploited.

Both versions should be described in the report in detail.

By the end of the week, you should export the partially patched box (.ova format) and send the link to the UC.

## Task 5: Exploit the new box (Week 11)

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note, that Lab Quiz 3 will be held this week!
{% endhint %}

You will be given a new box to exploit. The rest of the instruction is as same as Task 2 above.

## Task 6: Demo 2 (Week 12)

You are going to demonstrate your tasks 4 and 5 during the scheduled lab.

## Bonus mark (5%)

Participate in a research survey to receive a bonus of 5% marks. Details were provided in the announcement.
