## 4.1. Introduction

You will need your Kali VM, Windows VM, and the below prebuilt Linux VM.&#x20;

* [Pre-built Debian Linux VM](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6EDpYQYL72rQ2VuWS1QR2ZsUlU/view?resourcekey=0-JgB-ugTWuHTZqjHvKTM9yg)&#x20;
  * non-admin user: `user`:`password321`&#x20;
  * admin user.       : `root`:`password123`

{% hint style="info" %}
UTM copy is also available on Teams for this Linux VM.
{% endhint %}

### 4.1.1 Windows VM Setup

If you haven't done already, setup a Windows VM (tested with Windows 11 preview version) as described in [Lab 2](https://uwacyber.gitbook.io/cits3006/cits3006-labs/lab-2-malware#2.0.-setup-windows-vm). Once you have created an admin account and are now able to access the desktop, complete the following steps:

1. Login to the Windows VM using a user account that has administrator privileges.
2. Ensure the Windows VM does not have a user account named 'hank'. If it exists, delete it.
3.  Download the setup script on the Windows VM (the Desktop directory is fine).&#x20;

    ```
    wget https://github.com/uwacyber/cits3006/raw/2023S2/cits3006-labs/files/wsetup.bat -o wsetup.bat
    ```
4. Right click on the copied setup file and ensure to select from the pop-up menu 'run as Administrator'. This will setup the Windows system for the subsequent exercises.
5. Take note of the resulting output. One of the executed tasks is to create a new user account `hank` with password `password321`.

Restart the Windows VM and login to `hank`.

## 4.2 Windows Privilege Escalation

### 4.2.1 Insecure Service Permissions

Each service has an Access Control List (ACL) that specifies specific permissions to a certain service.

Some permissions are pretty harmful like being:

* able to query the configuration of the service: `sc qc <service>`
* able to check the current status of the service: `sc query <service>`
* able to start and stop the service: `net start/stop <service>`
* and change the configuration of the service: `sc config <service> <option>= <value>`

{% hint style="info" %}
you might need to type `sc.exe` instead of just `sc`.
{% endhint %}

If a user has permission to change the configuration of a service which runs with SYSTEM privileges, we can change the executable the service uses to one of our own, including a reverse shell. Let's discover the running services with any service enumeration tool, such as [winPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS) or by typing `Get-Service`. You will find an exhaustive list of services, one of which is the `daclsvc` service.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (32).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We'll need a tool named AccessChk, which you can download from the main site:

```
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/accesschk
```

Or a copy from our github repo:

```
wget https://github.com/uwacyber/cits3006/raw/2023S2/cits3006-labs/files/AccessChk.zip -o accesschk.zip
```

Once downloaded, extract the files.

Using the `accesschk.exe` tool, you can look at which services the user `hank` has permissions over (read the documentation to understand the meaning of flags):

```
.\accesschk64.exe -uwcqv "hank" *
```

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We've confirmed that `hank` has RW (read-write) permissions over the `daclsvc` service, including the `SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG` permission which grants the caller the right to change the executable file that the system runs. Thus, this permission should be granted only to administrators. What we can do now is elevate the permissions of this user to the administrator through this misconfigured service. We first check our current group membership for `hank`:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (34).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We first have to stop the service we wish to modify:

```
net stop daclsvc
```

Now we execute the command to add `hank` to the administrators group:

```
sc config daclsvc binPath= "net localgroup administrators hank /add"
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Note the space after `binPath=`
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (35).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now restart the service and check whether `hank` has been added to the administrators group or not.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Using the command `sc qc daclsvc`, we can also see the binary path that we have altered for the `daclsvc` service. Note the BINARY\_PATH\_NAME variable.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
With this service's misconfigured permissions, we can actually modify the binary path to contain whatever commands we want, such as the running of a reverse shell. You simply change the `binPath=` to be the path to a reverse shell executable, then the reverse shell will start whenever the service is called. You can manually start the service with `net start daclsvc`. Try this out as an exercise!
{% endhint %}

In an admin cmd, run the command `net localgroup administrators hank /delete` to remove the user from the administrators list as a preparation for the next exercises.

### 4.2.2 Unquoted Service Path

Services whose executable path contains spaces and isn't enclosed within quotes can lead to a privilege escalation. When a service is created whose executable path contains spaces and isnâ€™t enclosed within quotes, this leads to a vulnerability known as _Unquoted Service Path_ which allows a user to gain SYSTEM privileges (only if the vulnerable service is running with SYSTEM privilege level, which most of the time it is). if the service is not enclosed within quotes and is having spaces, it would handle the space as a break and pass the rest of the service path as an argument. This can be exploited to execute an arbitrary binary when the vulnerable service starts, which could allow escalating privileges to SYSTEM.

For this exercise, there will be a vulnerable service called `unquotedsvc` in your system. Inspect its configuration with `sc.exe qc unquotedsvc`.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We see that the binary path is missing the quotations around it. The path here is to the service .exe. Take note of the directory path itself, as this is where we can drop our malicious executables.

We are going to create a malicious executable that takes advantage of this vulnerability. This executable will perform a similar task to 4.2.1; it will grant the user administrator permissions. We will create this .exe in Kali with the command:

```
msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD='net localgroup administrators hank /add' -f exe-service -o common.exe
```

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The name `common.exe` is innocuous enough. Copy this .exe over to the Windows VM and place it within the `C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service` directory. In cmd, restart the service via `net stop/start unquotedsvc`.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once again, confirm that this user's permissions have been elevated via `net localgroup administrators`. You should see `hank` in the administrators list. Of course, you could plant any .exe you wanted, including reverse shells, etc.

### 4.2.3 Password Mining (Registry)

Password mining refers to the process of searching for and enumerating encrypted or clear-text passwords stored in persistent or volatile memory on the target system. In this exercise, we'll try to discover passwords stored in registry keys which may or may not be encrypted. One of these credential sets may have elevated permissions...

One place we can check is the automatic login credentials. Windows allows a user to automate the logging in process by storing passwords and other pertinent information in the registry database. Locate the default credentials using these commands in cmd:

```
reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon" /v DefaultUsername
reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon" /v DefaultPassword
```

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We see the credentials of our user with non-administrator permissions in plaintext.&#x20;

If there are other services running (e.g., PuTTY, TightVNC, etc.), you could also check the registry entries to see if there are any credentials. Sometimes they may be hashed, but you can use various hash crackers to retrieve the plaintext, if the credentials used are weak!

For example, crack the following credentials:

```
Password: EC84DB8BE7861E4D
PasswordViewOnly: 2B27C004F36D46D0
```

If you are on a Windows machine, check your own registry!

## 4.3 Linux Privilege Escalation (NOT READY)

### 4.3.1 Password Mining (Memory)

We can also similarly try to find passwords by digging into memory. First, let's establish an FTP server from our Kali to our Linux machines:

```
msfconsole
use auxiliary/server/ftp
set FTPUSER user
set FTPPASS password321
run
```

![](../.gitbook/assets/lab-4-assets/11.png)

The `user` and `password321` here are the credentials to be used when connecting to the server. Note that they are also they user credentials of the Linux VM user account. We can then connect to this server on our Linux via:

```
ftp [Kali VM IP Addr]
user
password321
```

![](../.gitbook/assets/lab-4-assets/12.png)

After which, exit the ftp using ctrl+z or cmd+z. Let's now try to look at the heap of the ftp service we just engaged with and search inside of it for some credentials. Let's take a look at any running ftp services:

```
ps -ef | grep ftp
```

![](../.gitbook/assets/lab-4-assets/13.png)

Make note of the PID of the ftp process. Now to get the memory dump:

```
gdb -p [FTP PID]
info proc mappings
```

![](../.gitbook/assets/lab-4-assets/15.png)

Make note of the start and end memory addresses of the \[heap]. Press 'q' to return, then enter:

```
dump memory /tmp/mem [Start Address] [End Address]
```

This will dump the memory to a file - /tmp/mem. We can then inspect this file to see if there are any password related things in there:

```
strings /tmp/mem | grep passw
```

![](../.gitbook/assets/lab-4-assets/16.png)

We see the credentials `root` and `password123` in plaintext, which are the root credentials for the Linux VM.

### 4.3.2 File Permissions (SUID Binary - Environment Variables #1)

## 4.4 Summary

We discovered a few different methods for escalating privilege when you have gained access as a user on a machine. Regardless of which OS you are on, there are always vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain higher privileges. Therefore, having proper security policies and security reviews is important (for example, misconfigurations are not typically picked up by anti-malware products or firewalls). Using the techniques above, you could also review if you have any misconfigurations that would allow malicious users who may gain access to your machine to elevate the privilege.

Next up, web security.

**Preparation**: We will be using docker to host web services for testing. It should be already loaded on Kali, but if it isn't please have it ready.
