## 4.0. Introduction

You will need your Kali VM, Metasploitable VM, and Windows 7 (not 10) VM. Refer to Lab 2 instructions if you haven't got those VMs already.

{% hint style="info" %}
We will use Windows 7 VM instead of Windows 10 VM, as it is much easier to turn off Windows Defender settings than on Windows 10 (especially for M1/M2 users). Also, some configurations are easier to set on Windows 7 to demonstrate the tasks done in this lab.

## 4.X Summary

Next up, Active Directory

{% hint style="info" %}
Please preview the next lab setup guide, as you will need to set up a new VM - Windows Server 2019. The size of the ISO is about 5GB, so it is a good idea to download that beforehand and get started on its installation (took me half an hour to get it set up FYI).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
M1/M2 users: setting up the Windows Server 2019 is extremely slow due to emulation (\~2 hours). So start early.

If you come to the F2F lab, the lab facilitator will have a copy of preinstalled Windows Server 2019 that you can load onto UTM, so grab that. However, it is still a good idea to read through (or actually try on an AMD64 machine) setting up the AD, as it is a good learning exercise.
