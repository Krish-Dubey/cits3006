## 4.0. Introduction

You will need your Kali VM, Metasploitable VM, and Windows 7 (not 10) VM. Refer to Lab 2 instructions if you haven't got those VMs already.

{% hint style="info" %}
We will use Windows 7 VM instead of Windows 10 VM, as it is much easier to turn off Windows Defender settings than on Windows 10 (especially for M1/M2 users). Also, some configurations are easier to set on Windows 7 to demonstrate the tasks done in this lab.
